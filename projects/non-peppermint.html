            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>My goal was to make a webpage with my partner Omar using my knowledge of basic HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that I learned in my SEP class. This is the first project that was assigned to us. We had to work with the person who sat next to us, and my partner and I decided to make a movie about being not peppermint.ince my teacher’s Mrs. Mueller favorite word is peppermint.  And how being peppermint is cool. We descided to do a project about not being peppermint. Its about two students who were not paying attention in class while the teacher is teaching so they are called not peppermint. The whole class calls them not peppermint.</p>
            <h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
            <p>The most challenging thing me and my partner experienced while working on our project was moving the inputs and submit button at the bottom of the website. We tried many ways to change their position but it wasn’t working. Looking up the code for changing position of inputs and asking Mrs. Mueller was very helpful with this challenge. Another challenge we had was finding the topic of the movie because there are many fun and interesting topics.</p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>A takeway I got from this project is collaboration is key. Without communicating and collaborating with my partner this project would have been very hard. Another takeaway is planning is very important. If me and my partner didn’t plan ahead of making the project it would have been difficult to make the website. And lastly looking at notes and looking up codes helps a lot with remembering how to do something if you forgot.</p>
